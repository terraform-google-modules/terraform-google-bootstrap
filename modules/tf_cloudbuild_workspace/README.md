## Overview

TF Cloud Build Workspace blueprint creates an opinionated workflow for actuating Terraform on Cloud Build. A set of Cloud Build triggers manage plan and apply operations on a root configuration stored in a VCS repo. Cloud Build triggers use a per workspace Service Account which can be configured with minimal permissions required by a given Terraform configuration. Optionally dedicated GCS buckets for state and log storage are also created.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "tf-net-workspace" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/bootstrap/google//modules/tf_cloudbuild_workspace"
  version = "~> 7.1"

  project_id          = var.project_id
  tf_repo_uri         = "https://github.com/org/tf-config-repo"
  cloudbuild_sa_roles = { var.project_id = ["roles/compute.networkAdmin"] }
}
```

Functional examples are included in the [examples](../../examples/) directory.

## Resources created

This module creates:
- Two Cloud Build triggers with an inline build configuration for planning and applying Terraform configuration. Optionally custom in repo build configs can be specified.
- Optional custom Service Account and roles for that SA used by Cloud Build triggers.
- GCS buckets for storing Terraform state, logs, and plans.

## Notes
- When a custom Service Account is provided via `cloudbuild_sa` and `diff_sa_project` is `true` (i.e SA is in a different project) follow [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/securing-builds/configure-user-specified-service-accounts#cross-project_set_up) to confirm `iam.disableCrossProjectServiceAccountUsage` org policy is not enforced in the SA project.
- If a custom build config is specified via `cloudbuild_plan/apply_filename`, a log bucket must be specified in the build config. For ease of use, we populate `_LOG_BUCKET_NAME` as a [substitution](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values) and can be used like `logsBucket: 'gs://$_LOG_BUCKET_NAME'`.
